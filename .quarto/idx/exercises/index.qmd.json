I couldn't figure out a cute way for you to be able to download this directly as a RMarkdown file (thwarted by quarto...). But this link will take you to the page in the course's GitHub repository where the RMarkdown file is stored. Click on \"Raw,\" then you can copy and paste the code into an RMarkdown on your computer.\n\n## Wednesday 2/22\n[Matching demo with simulated data](https://github.com/LauraDee/EcologyCausalInference/blob/main/exercises/matching_demo.Rmd)\n\n[Matching and Weighting replication exercise](https://github.com/LauraDee/EcologyCausalInference/tree/main/exercises/Siegel_and_Dee_2025_Exercises_intro_causal_inf)  \n\nIn this replication exercise, you will use a subset of the data in the data folder found in the above link; the data is from [Siegel et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-022-01950-y) to play around with matching and weighting using a real dataset. On the Github, there are two csv files of data: *colo_dat_full.csv* and *colo_data_for_matching.csv*. *colo_dat_full.csv* has the entire time series of data for the full (unmatched) dataset of federal and private forests in Colorado. *colo_data_for_matching.csv* is a file that's ready for the matching process without additional pre-processing: it has a row for each sample point in Colorado and five-year averages for the climate variables. \n\n## Monday 2/27\n[Diff-in-Diff regression demo in R](https://github.com/katherinesiegel/EBIOcausalinference/tree/main/exercises/DiD_demo)\nApplication and interpretation of differences-in-differences to examine effects of the Marshall Fire on vegetation in Boulder, CO. Data file is on GDrive. \n\nOptional: Review of difference-in-difference covered in lecture in RMarkdown, [see here](https://ds4ps.org/pe4ps-textbook/docs/p-030-diff-in-diff.html)\n\n## Monday 3/6\n[Panel regression demo in R](https://github.com/katherinesiegel/EBIOcausalinference/blob/main/exercises/Panel_demo/Rmarkdown_panel_designs_Dee_and_Severen.html)\nThis tutorial replicates the main analyses in Dee et al, contrasted with common approaches in ecology (mixed effect models and conditioning on observable covariates. For the rest of the supplemental analyses in Dee et al, see [L.Dee's GitHub](https://github.com/LauraDee/NutNetCausalinf)\n\n## Wednesday 3/15\n[Instrumental variables demo in R](https://github.com/katherinesiegel/EBIOcausalinference/blob/main/exercises/iv_demo.Rmd).
