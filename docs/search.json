    "section": "Course Description",
    "text": "Course Description\nHow does biodiversity effect ecosystem functioning? What are the consequences of temperature variability for parasite loads and host populations? How do plant communities respond to drought, and which ecosystems respond most? Do restoration and conservation work? How does climate change affect disturbance regimes? Cause and effect questions like these motivate much of the empirical work in basic and applied ecological and environmental sciences. Does X cause Y? If X causes Y, does it cause Y in all situations? Through what mechanisms does X cause Y? If X causes Y, how large is the effect of X on Y and how does the size compare to other causes of Y? To answer these cause-and-effect questions, a counterfactual model of causality and a unified methodological framework has been developed yet is not often taught or emphasized in ecology and EBIO more generally. Now this framework is the predominant approach for causal inference in a diversity of fields including public health, economics, and computer science (which is also referred to as program evaluation or impact evaluation).\nGiven the increasing access to spatiotemporally large observational datasets (e.g., remotely sensed data, data from long-term ecological monitoring), we have unprecedented opportunities to answer questions about causal relationships and mechanisms outside of the context of traditional ecological approaches to experimental design. Deriving causal inferences from observational data presents its own set of challenges, and this course presents statistical methods to overcome challenges for causal inference in both observational and experimental study designs.\nThis class aims to teach students to apply and interpret the counterfactual causality model and associated methods in answering empirical questions in basic and applied ecology. As a 3-credit graduate course, this course has a corresponding reading load with an emphasis on readings that elucidate the intuition and the application of the core conceptual ideas. We are firm believers that the most fundamental principles can be stated in plain English and conceptual understanding is just as important as the math. Thus the course stresses intuition (in English) over mechanics and proofs. Nevertheless, students will be expected to apply the mechanics in replication exercises in R statistical software and in a final a project related to the students’ thesis.\nWhether you are a student with substantial graduate work in empirical methods or a student with only the basic pre-requisites covered (some introductory statistics or biostatistics is required), you should expect to gain a deeper understanding of approaches to answering causal questions and of the nature of evidence. Importantly, you will see more clearly the conceptual connections among the various approaches to estimating causal effects – experiments and observational analyses. Even for students with substantial coursework in statistics, these connections are often missed.\nWhile most students who will take this class are in EBIO fields, you should expect to do readings outside of EBIO areas and to see examples from other fields – because ecology and evolutionary biology is lagging a bit behind other fields in several areas we will cover (but catching up fast!). On the bright side, reading beyond the typical EBIO papers will provide you with an entry point into the broader literature on causal inference, stemming from economics, public health, epidemiology, political science, and other fields. Thus, we see the use of broader readings and examples as intentional to meet the course’s learning objectives, and as a potential competitive advantage – and a way to expand your thinking – rather than a distraction from topics that interest you most. In our experience, gaining perspective on methods and language used in other fields will also provide you with skills to foster collaborations across disciplines. We will also invite guest speakers who are experts to showcase applications of the theory and approaches to questions and data in ecology, conservation, and evolution/behavior – and present some of our in-progress research using causal inference approaches applied to EBIO.\nWe have outlined a provisional syllabus below, but we can adapt it based on student interests and background. The main emphasis of the course is like any other graduate course: to encourage students to think critically, to speak and write simply and clearly, collaborate, to own and use a body of facts and ideas that are widely known, to detect errors and fallacies, to resolve intellectual problems, and to advance our collective knowledge through independent research and applied statistics.",

    "title": "Panel Data and Fixed Effects Designs for Ecology",
    "section": "Simple correlations in single years",
    "text": "Simple correlations in single years\nLet’s begin by looking at simple correlations. We will examine both the overall correlation and correlations within a single year (i.e., using cross-sectional variation). We proceed with a linear regression framework @ref(eq:eq1), using the log of productivity (measured as live aboveground biomass) as the outcome and the log species richness as the explanatory variable. We’ve found that a log-log specification captures the nature of the relationship in our data well (see Figure @ref(fig:graphbiomasssp) below and the paper for details).\nWe initially estimate and report \\(\\beta\\) in: \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\ln(\\text{Live Mass}_{pst}) = \\alpha + \\beta \\ln(\\text{Richness}_{pst}) + e_{pst}\n(\\#eq:eq1)\n\\end{equation}\\] where \\(p\\) indexes plots, \\(s\\) indexes sites, and \\(t\\) indexes years. The unobserved error term is \\(e_{pst}\\). We include a constant \\(\\alpha\\), but do not report estimates of it as it tells us little.\nWe report results below using all years of data first, and then report results using two individual years: 2012 and 2013. Here, as everywhere below, we cluster standard errors by plot to reflect serial correlation in errors terms within a plot across years (we do not assume that errors are iid). Note that when we use only a single year of data, this is equivalent to using heteroskedasticity-robust errors.\n\n\nCode\n# SimpleCorrAll &lt;- feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich), comb, cluster = \"newplotid\") \n# \n# SimpleCorr2012 &lt;- comb %&gt;%\n#   filter(year==2012) %&gt;%\n#   feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich), ., cluster = \"newplotid\") \n# \n# SimpleCorr2013 &lt;- comb %&gt;%\n#   filter(year==2013) %&gt;%\n#   feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich), ., cluster = \"newplotid\") \n# \n# etable(SimpleCorrAll, SimpleCorr2012, SimpleCorr2013, \n#           cluster = \"newplotid\", \n#           drop = \"Intercept\", \n#           subtitles = c(\"Data All Years\", \"Data in 2012\", \"Data in 2013\"))  \n\n\nAs you can see, using all years of data gives a non-significant positive relationship between productivity and richness. In just the 2012 data, the coefficient is larger in magnitude, but still not significant. Finally, just using 2013 data, the coefficient switches signs and becomes significant.\nSo… which one to believe? Well, probably none of these, because they likely do not identify the true causal effect of richness on productivity. Their variability highlights that these estimates, which rely on non-experimental cross-sectional data, are likely contaminated by omitted variable bias.\nWhen does \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) capture a causal relationship? When there are no unobservables that are correlated with richness that also influence productivity: \\(\\mathbb{E}[e_{pst} \\times \\ln(\\text{Richness}_{pst})]=0\\) (i.e., \\(e_{pst}\\) and \\(\\ln(\\text{Richness}_{pst})\\) aren’t correlated). In the above results, there’s probably stuff in \\(e\\) that is correlated with richness, like precipitation, disturbance, land-use history, soil characteristics, and other characteristics of sites and plots.\nA Directed Acyclic Diagram (DAG) can help us see the challenges of omitted, and potentially confounding, variables more clearly. In the above analyses from equation @ref(eq:eq1), \\(\\beta\\) is only identified if we assume that any variables that matter but that we omitted are uncorrelated with richness. One benefit of a DAG is that it makes transparent the assumptions on which one relies for making causal claims from observable data. A DAG therefore allows the researcher and the reader to better judge the credibility of the causal claims from a specific research design. Another way to view this benefit is that a causal graph helps identify the sources of variation in a causal variable and in its outcome, thereby emphasizing potential sources of bias that must be addressed in a research design and pointing to designs that can address these sources of statistical bias [@morganCounterfactualsCausalInference2014].\nIn our case, many variables that are correlated with biodiversity can also drive productivity (Fig. 1B – main text), creating the possibility for rival explanations and biased estimates for estimated effects from observations. For example, climatic conditions, soil nutrients, evolutionary history, and historic contingency during community assembly are all related to both productivity and biodiversity [@Loreau1998;@fukamiCommunityAssemblyAlternative2011;@graceIntegrativeModellingReveals2016]. With a common driver of both variables that is not included in a model, two variables (i.e., biodiversity and an ecosystem function) may be correlated, even when there is no causal relationship between them. Similarly, no correlation between variables does not imply a lack of causation. Causal relationships can also be masked when examining correlations, due to an omitted variable (e.g., nitrogen addition), which positively affects productivity but negatively affects richness [@isbellNutrientEnrichmentBiodiversity2013]. Models that do not control for that common driver will consequently tend to give estimates that do not correspond to causal effects of biodiversity on productivity (or vice versa).\n\n  \n\nFigure 1B (main text – right panel) is known as a directed acyclic causal graph (DAG) and is a visualization of qualitative causal assumptions ([@pearl2009causality; @pearl2011aspects;@fieberg2012understanding; @schoolmaster2013causal; @schoolmaster2020graphical; @Grace2020]). A DAG encodes knowledge and beliefs about how a system works. The graphical relations depicted in the DAG encode causal claims – not just representations of associations. A directed edge (e.g., R –&gt; P) depicts a claim about the results of many hypothetical experiments, whereby if every other variable represented in the graph is held fixed, R and P will covary if R if manipulated, but not if P is manipulated (note, a DAG assumes that one can isolate the effect of R on P, but does not imply that P can never affect R; another DAG may represent the reverse direction, P –&gt; R).\n\nTAKEAWAY:\nOmitted variable bias is a pervasive feature in observational analysis, and the assumptions that permit identification of causal effects are unlikely to hold when using cross-sectional variation."

    "text": "Common Ecological Design - Multivariate Regression\nOf course, in the above correlations, we include plots in sites from across the world, implicitly comparing grasslands in warmer climates with those in cooler ones, or wetter with dryer, or Europe with the Americas. There are a lot of differences between these places!\nA common response to this problem is to try to measure these differences and include them in the model. In the causal inference literature, this is known as “conditioning on observables” or Pearl’s back-door criteria. Conditioning on observables is convenient but makes strong assumptions for causal inference, namely the “Selection on Observables” Assumption. Informally, this assumption implies that confounding variables that could introduce bias into a design are known and observable to the researcher. The bias they introduce into an estimator can be eliminated (controlled, blocked) by conditioning strategies, such as regression, matching, or stratification methods. To read more, see [@morganCounterfactualsCausalInference2014]. We can visualize this assumption by modifying our DAG, and using some examples in R:\n\n  \n\nTo explore the consequences of adding in covariates, we show the results of five models below. The first column repeats the first column from above. The second column adds in soil chemistry covariates, the third column instead adds weather covariates, and the fourth instead adds management variables plus habitat. The last columns adds in everything. For the purposes of this tutorial, we only show coefficient estimates for richness in the following table, even though the other terms are included in the model.\n\n\nCode\n# SoilCovars &lt;- feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich) +\n#                       pct_C + pct_N + ppm_P + ppm_K + ppm_Na + ppm_Mg + ppm_S + ppm_Na + ppm_Zn +  ppm_Mn +  ppm_Fe + ppm_Cu + ppm_B +\n#                       pH + PercentSand + PercentSilt + PercentClay, \n#                     comb, cluster = \"newplotid\") \n# \n# WeatherCovars &lt;- feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich) +\n#                          elevation + TEMP_VAR_v2 + MIN_TEMP_v2 + MAX_TEMP_v2 + TEMP_WET_Q_v2 + TEMP_DRY_Q_v2 + TEMP_WARM_Q_v2 + \n#                          TEMP_COLD_Q_v2, \n#                        comb, cluster = \"newplotid\") \n# \n# MgmtCovars &lt;- feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich) +\n#                       as.factor(habitat) + managed + burned + grazed + anthropogenic, \n#                     comb, cluster = \"newplotid\") \n# \n# AllCovars &lt;- feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich) +\n#                      pct_C + pct_N + ppm_P + ppm_K + ppm_Na + ppm_Mg + ppm_S + ppm_Na + ppm_Zn +  ppm_Mn +  ppm_Fe + ppm_Cu + ppm_B +\n#                      pH + PercentSand + PercentSilt + PercentClay +\n#                      elevation + TEMP_VAR_v2 + MIN_TEMP_v2 + MAX_TEMP_v2 + TEMP_WET_Q_v2 + TEMP_DRY_Q_v2 + TEMP_WARM_Q_v2 +\n#                      TEMP_COLD_Q_v2 + as.factor(habitat) + managed + burned + grazed + anthropogenic, \n#                    comb, cluster = \"newplotid\") \n# \n# etable(SimpleCorrAll, SoilCovars, WeatherCovars, MgmtCovars, AllCovars,\n#           cluster = \"newplotid\", \n#           drop = \"!rich\", \n#           subtitles = c(\"Data All Years\", \"+ Soil\", \"+ Weather\", \"+ Management\", \"+ All\")) \n\n\nEstimates jump around depending on which covariates are used! This is likely a sign of some sort of omitted variables bias. Even though we consecutively explain more and more of the variation in the data, we are not necessarily any closer to a causal relationship.\nThere are a few other points to make about the above results that speak the practice of science.\n1.First, the number of observations changes based on which controls we use. Columns 2 and 5, where we only have 675 observations, might be on highly selected and not representative of the overall populations under study. A careful analysis could do any of a number of approaches to control for that, but far too often we just say ``This is what I have (all the) data for, so this what I estimate.’’ It would be nice if there were a way to move forward even if we were unable to collect data on all the variables we wanted.\n2.Second, and more perniciously, is specification hunting. What’s to keep from only displaying results in columns 2 and 5 above, with no mention of the other results. P-hacking is something we should all be concerned about, but it’s really easy to twiddle and play until one gets just the right set of results that agree with ones hypothesis.\n3.Lastly, we assumed that all the covariates entered linearly and did not interact. What if what really matters is the interaction of nitrogen and precipitation? How do we capture that? We could include interactions and quadratics, or splines, but at some point, the number of covariates will exceed our sample size and nothing is identified.\n\nTAKEAWAY:\nIt is hard to assume the we observe and correctly control for all confounding variables when analyzing cross-sectional data"

    "section": "Plot Fixed Effects",
    "text": "Plot Fixed Effects\nLet’s ignore sites for a minute, and just think about the plots that lie in a single site. We’re going to estimate the following model: \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\ln(\\text{Live Mass}_{pt}) = \\beta \\ln(\\text{Richness}_{pt}) + \\delta_p + \\mu_t + e_{pt}\n\\end{equation}\\] where we’ve added the term \\(\\delta_p\\). This represents a vector of plot-specific fixed effect—a dummy variable for each plot. We also add time fixed effects (\\(\\mu_t\\), a dummy for each year) to control for the common differences to all plots in a year (in a site). We’ll touch on that more later, but really, the plot fixed effects are of greatest consequence.\nWhat does adding this vector of plot dummy variables do? Two big things. First, it controls for any and all time-invariant features of the plot, whether we observe them or not!!! To see this, imagine putting in a variable \\(x_p\\) into the above equation linearly with the coefficient \\(\\gamma\\). We wouldn’t actually be able to estimate \\(\\gamma x_p\\); it’s already a component of \\(\\delta_p\\). Don’t know what functional for you should use for \\(x_p\\) or whether it should be interacted with another variable? That’s fine, that’s already included in \\(\\delta_p\\)! We get a whole lot for the inclusion of this variable. Let’s see our updated DAG: now we have removed confounding effects from plot-level attributes whether we can measure them or not!\n\n  \n\nSecond, and most importantly conceptually, is that we are no longer directly comparing different plots; we aren’t using cross-sectional variation any more. Instead, we are using variation in richness and productivity within the same plot over time. So, we’re implicitly comparing a plot in year \\(t\\) with this same plot in year \\(t+k\\) for some \\(k\\). Another way to see this is that we could write a very similar equation in differences (ignore the \\(\\mu_t\\) for a moment): \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left(\\ln(\\text{Live Mass}_{pt})-\\ln(\\text{Live Mass}_{pt-1}) \\right)= \\beta \\left( \\ln(\\text{Richness}_{pt}) - \\ln(\\text{Richness}_{pt-1}) \\right) + \\left( e_{pt} - e_{pt-1}\\right)\n\\end{equation}\\] Where did \\(\\lambda_p\\) go? Well, \\(\\lambda_p-\\lambda_p=0\\), so we don’t need it. (NB: We could also subtract the mean of each variable over time within each plot and arrive at a similar estimator. There are subtle differences between the two approaches that depend on the nature of the error terms \\(e\\), but they draw on the same source of variation).\nWhat do we have to assume for a causal interpretation? There are a couple of different assumptions we could choose; I think it’s easiest to frame it like this: \\(\\mathbb{E}[ (e_{pt} - e_{pt-1}) \\times (\\ln(\\text{Richness}_{pt}) - \\ln(\\text{Richness}_{pt-1}))]=0\\). That is, changes in richness are uncorrelated with changes in unobserved determinants of richness. Because time-invariant unobservable variables do not change, they are no longer a concern! Instead, we’re concerned if movements in some unobserved factor could both be driving our outcome variable and be correlated with richness.\nWhat’s the cost? Well, there are a few to consider, but some really aren’t much of a restriction:\n\nWe use to worry about computational issues. Instead of differencing, we could have including the additional fixed effects as regressors. Were this a large vector, computation could have become difficult. This is rarely a concern thanks to better computers and better techniques.\nWe need longitudinal (panel) data (or repeated cross sections in some special circumstances). This is why economists get so much use out of administrative data! This data is rarer in ecology, but with the growth in LTERs and other multi-year sites, this will be less of a constraint.\nOur target of interest has to be time-varying. Any interesting time-invariant factors have been removed from the equation (literally).\n\nFigures @ref(fig:graphrawvary) and @ref(fig:graphdeplotFE) illustrate graphically what the plot fixed effects do to the outcome variable (productivity). Figures @ref(fig:graphrawvary) is just the raw data, and shows log(live mass) in four plots split between two sites (at the Sedgwick Reserve [sedg.us] and at the Sevilleta LTER [sevi.us]). Sedgwick has higher productivity on average. The productivity at these sites also appear to be following different trajectories through time (e.g., note the dip in productivity at Sevilleta in 2009). The plot fixed effects remove the average productivity in each site, as shown in Figure @ref(fig:graphdeplotFE). They do not remove site-and-year specific sources of confounding variation (e.g., if a more extreme drought happened at Sevilleta than at Sedgwick in 2009 affecting both productivity and richness); we turn to eliminating site and year specific confounding variables below in @ref(fig:graphdeplotsiteyearFE).\nTo the statistical model: We’re first going to estimate the following equation site-by-site on the five sites with the largest number of observations (in terms of the number plot-years we observe; see Table S1). \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\ln(\\text{Live Mass}_{pt}) = \\beta \\ln(\\text{Richness}_{pt}) + \\delta_p + \\mu_t + e_{pt}\n\\end{equation}\\] The year fixed effects \\(\\mu_t\\) control for time-varying factors (observed or unobserved) that affect all plots at the site under consideration. For example, suppose 2007 was a particularly damp and rainy year at the site; \\(\\mu_t\\) controls for the average impact of that across all plots. Because what happens at one site in a year is probably very different from what happens at a different site in the same year, we estimate these separately for each site. This will make the point estimates for each site less precise (especially because we’re clustering by plot), but this is just for illustration’s sake.\n\n\nCode\n# PlotFE_1 &lt;- comb %&gt;%\n#   filter(site_code==\"cdcr.us\") %&gt;%\n#   feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich) | newplotid + year, ., cluster = \"newplotid\")\n# \n# PlotFE_2 &lt;- comb %&gt;%\n#   filter(site_code==\"cdpt.us\") %&gt;%\n#   feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich) | newplotid + year, ., cluster = \"newplotid\")\n# \n# PlotFE_3 &lt;- comb %&gt;%\n#   filter(site_code==\"koffler.ca\") %&gt;%\n#   feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich) | newplotid + year, ., cluster = \"newplotid\")\n# \n# PlotFE_4 &lt;- comb %&gt;%\n#   filter(site_code==\"sedg.us\") %&gt;%\n#   feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich) | newplotid + year, ., cluster = \"newplotid\")\n# \n# PlotFE_5 &lt;- comb %&gt;%\n#   filter(site_code==\"sier.us\") %&gt;%\n#   feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich) | newplotid + year, ., cluster = \"newplotid\")\n# \n# etable(SimpleCorrAll, PlotFE_1, PlotFE_2, PlotFE_3, PlotFE_4, PlotFE_5,\n#           cluster = \"newplotid\", \n#           drop = \"!rich\", \n#           subtitles = c(\"Data All Years\",\"US - CDCR\", \"US - CDPT\", \"CA - Koffler\", \"US - SEDG\", \"US - SIER\" )) \n\n\nWe again show the bivariate correlation on all sites first (SimpleCorrAll), and then the estimate for each site. Whoa! Now we’re getting some negative coefficients (though mostly insignificant due to smaller effective sample sizes). We’re controlling for lots and lots of things that we couldn’t control for before, either because we didn’t think to include them or we couldn’t collect data on them. The R-squared values confirm that this is the case; we’re generally explaining much more of the data than before (but note: R-squared values are NOT important for causal interpretations generally). Note that, with the plot fixed effects, we do not have much statistical power estimating sites individually.\n\nTAKEAWAY:\nUsing unit fixed effects in panel data shifts the identifying variation from across units to within units over time."

    "text": "Bringing it all Together with Site-by-Year Fixed Effects\nWe now combine all sites together to give us more statistical power to detect effects. We do want to account for the fact that different sites experience different conditions in different years. To do so in a flexible way, we include site-by-year fixed effects, \\(\\mu_{st}\\). \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\ln(\\text{Live Mass}_{pst}) = \\beta \\ln(\\text{Richness}_{pst}) + \\delta_p + \\delta_{st} +  e_{pst}\n\\end{equation}\\] These additional fixed effects control for all time-varying effects that impact the site as whole (i.e., that apply to all the plots equally). Thus, they capture the first order effects of weather, among other factors that could shift outcomes for the site as whole. This gives us sufficient power to conduct conservative inference on our estimated average treatment effect.\nTo get a sense for what these site-by-year effects do, first recall Figure @ref(fig:graphdeplotFE). Plots that are in the same site seem to have similar movements in productivity over time, even after controlling for plot fixed effects. The site-by-year fixed effects remove the average of everything that happens across the site in the data in a year (e.g., a drought at a site). Figure @ref(fig:graphdeplotsiteyearFE) removes this variation; see how the big drop in Sevilleta live mass in 2009 is much less Figure in @ref(fig:graphdeplotsiteyearFE).\nTo provide confidence that the results are robust, we will also include a couple of time-varying controls, evenness and lagged richness. NB: To make sure we don’t drop locations with values of zero evenness, we use the inverse hyperbolic sine instead of the natural log. Note that we don’t need to worry about that for productivity or richness because they never take a zero value.\n\n\nCode\n# ihs &lt;- function(x) {\n#   y &lt;- log(x+sqrt(x^2 + 1))\n# }\n# \n# \n# MainMod_Rich     &lt;- feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich)  | newplotid + site.by.yeardummy, comb) \n# MainMod_RichEven &lt;- feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich) + ihs(even) | newplotid + site.by.yeardummy, comb) \n# MainMod_RichLag  &lt;- feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich) + log(laggedrich) | newplotid + site.by.yeardummy, comb) \n# MainMod_RichEvenLag &lt;- feols(log(live_mass) ~ log(rich) + log(laggedrich) + ihs(even) | newplotid + site.by.yeardummy, comb)\n# \n# etable(MainMod_Rich, MainMod_RichEven, MainMod_RichLag, MainMod_RichEvenLag,\n#           cluster = \"newplotid\")\n\n\nAs you can see, estimate on log richness are relatively stable across different specifications. Of special note: the coefficient on lagged richness (richness from the year before) is small and insignificant, given us confidence that our results reflect contemporaneous movement in richness, and not some factor that is also correlated with last year’s richness.\n\nTAKEAWAY:\nFixed effects can alter the research design and control for a wide variety of potentially confounding factors!\n\nOur updated DAG, including both plot and site-by-year fixed effects, show that we can control more flexibly for a broader set of confounding variables in space and time – critically, whether they are measured or not!"

Here’s a basic logistic regression model, but feel free to tweak it.\n\n\nCode\n# ### Model\n# colo_model &lt;- glmer(burned ~ # covariates you're including + \n#                       \n#                       ### include an interaction between year and ownership \n#                       ### don't forget to tell R that prot_cat_recl is a factor\n#                       prot_cat_recl*year + \n#                       \n#                       ### add the lag variable\n#                       burn_prev_5_yr +\n#                       \n#                       ### and a site-level effect to account for unobservable \n#                       ### factors unique to each site\n#                       (1|UID),\n#                     \n#                     ### tell it where to get the data from\n#                     data = full_data, \n#                     \n#                     ### model parameters\n#                     family = binomial(link = \"logit\"),\n#                     nAGQ = 0,\n#                     control = glmerControl(optimizer = \"nloptwrap\"))\n\n### Extract the model's coefficient estimates"

    "text": "Programming in R will be a key part of this course, and as most of you have probably experienced, R can cause headaches and stress! Files go missing, package dependencies spiral out of control, and minor code errors can cost us hours of troubleshooting. The point of this course is not to become an R whiz, and I don’t want code errors or coding anxiety to get in the way of your learning and research progress.\nI encourage you to use online resources for coding help if/when you get stuck. StackOverflow is a great resource for finding solutions to coding issues or asking a specific question, as is the RStudio Community. BlueSky can also be a great resource: if you post a question with the hashtag #rstats, a kind soul might give you an answer. If you’re looking for help via Google, we recommend including in your query the package you’re using and if applicable, the error message you’re getting. Finally, if you are a visual learner, Allison Horst has some great learning tools for various R functions.\nIf you could use some more training and exposure to R, here are some resources to get started:\n\nswirl teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console! On this page, swirl will walk you through each of the steps required to begin using R and swirl today!\n\nR for data science (R4DS). R4DS teaches you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualize it and model it. The book is available online, where you can find a practicum of skills for data science from visualization to wrangling and writing functions.\n\nHave a favorite resource? Please send it to Laura to post!\n\nIf you use Python instead, many of the free, online books we will use (The Effect, Causal MixTape, etc.) have code snippets in both R and Python",

    "text": "Main assignment\nThe main assignment will be either to complete and write up a data analysis or to do a literature review and deep dive on a particular subtopic (ideas listed below). The project or literature review will culminate in a presentation the last week of classes and a final written report.\nMany students in the past have used this course as an opportunity to advance their thesis research or pursue and publish a paper based on their analyses or literature review!\n\nFinal Project Option 1: Data analysis project\nFor the final project that takes the form of a data analysis, each student will complete a project according to the following process: identifying a research question, creating a DAG, choosing and applying a data analysis, and writing up a methods and results section that 1) articulates the causal relationship of interest, 2) describes the causal identification strategy and choice of study design/methods, 3) describes the implicit assumptions on which this strategy rests, and 4) interprets the results and their potential biases. I encourage students to base this analysis on their thesis research to get the most out of the class.\n\n\nFinal Project Option 2: Literature review\nAlternatively, students can complete a literature review that provides a deeper dive on a topic we do not cover in detail in this course (*some ideas are listed below). This direction may be more appropriate for students who are not at a stage of performing analyses for their thesis, who do not have a relevant project that is tackling an empirical causal question, or who are interested in learning more about a topic not covered under our guidance.\n\nFinal project presentation\nGuidelines for all presentations:\n\n8 minute presentation + 2 minutes for questions\n\nIntroduce the question you address and the motivation for your project\n\nSpecific guidelines for data analysis project presentations:\n\nDescribe the causal inference approach you took and why you chose that approach\n\nPresent your DAG\n\nBriefly describe the data you used\n\nShare your results AND contextualize them with the important limitations and assumptions of the method(s) you used\n\nOutline possible next steps you could take to make your analysis more robust in the future\nSpecific guidelines for literature review presentations:\nDescribe the challenge for causal inference\n\nDescribe and critique the current approaches people are taking\n\nPresent your ideas for how the field could better incorporate causal inference methods\n\n\n\nFinal project write up\nFor data analysis projects: ~ 5 pages (not including tables and figures, but don’t stress over the page count)\nFor literature review projects: ~ 10 pages, but don’t stress over the page count – focus on what you need to include to write a compelling paper",
