The formulas are added to show how the weights are calculated based on the **Probability of High Pollution** (P(T=1)) for each island.\n\n- **Distance to Shoreline**: Represents the proximity of the island to the shoreline.\n- **Treatment (High vs Low Pollution)**: 1 for high pollution exposure, 0 for low pollution exposure.\n- **Probability of High Pollution (P(T=1))**: The estimated likelihood of high pollution exposure for each island.\n\n### Updated Table with Formulas for IPTW:\n\n| Island ID | Distance to Shoreline (km) | Treatment (T) | Probability of High Pollution (P(T=1)) | Weight (IPTW)  |\n|-----------|----------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|\n| 1         | 1.2                        | 1             | 0.85                                   | \\( \\frac{1}{0.85} = 1.18 \\)  |\n| 2         | 2.5                        | 0             | 0.45                                   | \\( \\frac{1}{1 - 0.45} = 1.82 \\)  |\n| 3         | 0.8                        | 1             | 0.70                                   | \\( \\frac{1}{0.70} = 1.43 \\)  |\n| 4         | 3.0                        | 0             | 0.30                                   | \\( \\frac{1}{1 - 0.30} = 1.43 \\)  |\n| 5         | 1.5                        | 1             | 0.75                                   | \\( \\frac{1}{0.75} = 1.33 \\)  |\n| 6         | 4.0                        | 0             | 0.20                                   | \\( \\frac{1}{1 - 0.20} = 1.25 \\)  |\n| 7         | 2.0                        | 1             | 0.90                                   | \\( \\frac{1}{0.90} = 1.11 \\)  |\n| 8         | 5.0                        | 0             | 0.10                                   | \\( \\frac{1}{1 - 0.10} = 1.11 \\)  |\n\n### Formulas for Calculating Weight (IPTW):\n- **For treated islands (T=1)**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Weight} = \\frac{1}{P(T=1)}\n  \\]\n  Where \\( P(T=1) \\) is the probability of being exposed to **high pollution** (probability of treatment).\n\n- **For untreated islands (T=0)**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Weight} = \\frac{1}{1 - P(T=1)}\n  \\]\n  Where \\( 1 - P(T=1) \\) represents the probability of being exposed to **low pollution** (complement of treatment probability).\n\n### Example of Calculation:\n\n- For **Island 1** (treated, high pollution):\n  - Probability of high pollution = 0.85\n  - Weight: \n    \\[\n    \\frac{1}{0.85} = 1.18\n    \\]\n  \n- For **Island 2** (untreated, low pollution):\n  - Probability of high pollution = 0.45\n  - Weight: \n    \\[\n    \\frac{1}{1 - 0.45} = 1.82\n    \\]\n\n\n",
